title: State
description: Access the simulation state from the game context

## Introduction

The core game state holds useful information about the current simulation.

<Callout type="warn">
  Most of the state is handled automatically during simulation, or when calling service
  methods. You won't need to touch most of it. Defined [custom additional
  state](/docs/core/config/custom-state) is available under `ctx.state.userData`
</Callout>

Wrong usage can break simulations!

## Properties

| Property                | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `currentGameMode`       | `string`              | The name of the currently simulated game mode.<br/>**Serves internal purposes only. Do not modify!**                                         |
| `currentSpinType`       | `string`              | As defined under `SPIN_TYPE`.                                                                                                                |
| `currentResultSet`      | `ResultSet`           | The current result set. Useful to conditionally do things to achieve certain outcomes.<br/>**Serves internal purposes only. Do not modify!** |
| `isCriteriaMet`         | `boolean`             | **Serves internal purposes only. Do not modify!**                                                                                            |
| `currentFreespinAmount` | `number`              | Stores the number of remaining free spins. Increased using `awardFreespins()` from game service. Reduce manually.                            |
| `totalFreespinAmount`   | `number`              | Stores the number of total awarded free spins. Increased using `awardFreespins()` from game service. Don't reduce.                           |
| `triggeredFreespins`    | `boolean`             | Whether free spins were triggered. Set using `awardFreespins()` from game service.                                                           |
| `triggeredMaxWin`       | `boolean`             | Whether a max win was triggered. Set automatically at the end of a simulation.                                                               |
| `userData`              | `Record<string, any>` | Custom user state as defined in the game config. Do with it what you want.                                                                   |
