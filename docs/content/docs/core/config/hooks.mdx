## Introduction

Hooks are a way of adding your own code on top of Slot Engine.
They allow you to execute code or update state at specific points of the program.

## List of Hooks

These are the hooks you can define in your game configuration.

### onHandleGameFlow

| Property           | Type                         | Required |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `onHandleGameFlow` | `(ctx: GameContext) => void` | yes      |

The complete game logic must be [implemented](/docs/core/game-flow) in this hook.

### onSimulationAccepted

| Property               | Type                         | Required |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `onSimulationAccepted` | `(ctx: GameContext) => void` |          |

This hook is called after a simulation is accepted and the payout has been written to the book.
Useful to run code after completing a simulation and before continuing with the next.

<Callout title="Important">
  **No payouts or results should be altered using this hook!** But adding additional data
  with `ctx.services.data.record()` is perfectly fine.
