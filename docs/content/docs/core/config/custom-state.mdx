## State in Slot Engine

The game state holds information about the current simulation,
such as the current simulation ID or whether free spins were triggered.
By design, the game state includes only essential game flow properties to reduce bloat.
When developers need to track additional information—such as whether a specific feature was triggered—
they should define custom state properties.

## Defining custom State

To define additional state, use the `defineUserState` function and pass the resulting object to your game configuration.

For example:

```ts lineNumbers
import { defineUserState, createSlotGame, InferGameType } from "@slot-engine/core"

export const userState = defineUserState({
  triggeredSuperFreespins: false,
  freespinsUpgradedToSuper: false,
  globalMultiplier: 1
})

export type UserStateType = typeof userState

export type GameType = InferGameType<any, any, UserStateType>

export const game = createSlotGame<GameType>({
  /* the rest of your configuration */
  userState,
})
```

The values defined here will be set as the initial values for each state property on every new simulation.

## Using custom State

In your [game implementation](/docs/core/game-implementation), you will have access to the underlying state via the context.
From there you can access your custom state.

```ts lineNumbers
export function onHandleGameFlow(ctx: GameContext) {
  /* the rest of your game flow */

  // Example usage
  if (ctx.state.userData.triggeredSuperFreespins) {
    ctx.state.userData.globalMultiplier = 10
  }
}
```
