## Introduction

A game mode defines a **purchasable** game behavior, similar to "bet modes" in the Stake Math SDK.
Game modes can vary in cost, outcomes, symbols, and mechanics.

Common game mode patterns include:

- **Base game** - The standard gameplay at 1x bet multiplier
- **Ante Bet** - Increased odds of hitting free spins for extra cost
- **Bonus game** - e.g. 100x bet for instant free spins
- **Super bonus** - e.g. 500x bet for instant super free spins

Players can bet on the base game or purchase bonus features directly.
A "base" mode can still include free spins triggered naturally, while a dedicated "bonus" mode
allows immediate access for an extra cost.

## Defining Game Modes

Game modes usually require a lot of configuration. They define which symbols make up your reel strips
and which simulation results to output. Here is a relatively simple example with one game mode:

```ts lineNumbers
import { defineGameModes, GameMode } from "@slot-engine/core"

export const gameModes = defineGameModes({
  base: new GameMode({
    name: "base",
    cost: 1,
    rtp: 0.96,
    reelsAmount: 5,
    symbolsPerReel: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
    isBonusBuy: false,
    reelSets: [
      /* list of reel sets */
    ],
    resultSets: [
      /* list of result sets */
    ],
  }),
})
```

## GameMode Constructor Options [#options]

All options are required.

| Property         | Type              | Description                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`           | `string`          | Name of the game mode. Must match the key as set in `defineGameModes`.   |
| `reelsAmount`    | `number`          | Number of reels the board has.                                           |
