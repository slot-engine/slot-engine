## Introduction

Slot games have thousands if not millions of possible outcomes—each spin is different.
A player shouldn't see the exact same outcome twice. With result sets you **ensure diverse simulation results**.
You want to ensure there are plenty of zero-win scenarios as well as many different max win simulations—
and everything in between.

Before a simulation run starts, each simulation is assigned one of the specified result sets
based on the total quota of all result sets for a game mode, and must fulfill its criteria.
Only when a **simulation meets the expected result set criteria** does the program proceed to the next simulation.

Result sets commonly cover the following scenarios:

- Zero-win spins
- Win spins
- Free spins
- Max wins

But developers can also specify very detailed and rare criteria:

- Free spins upgraded to super bonus resulting in max win

**Result sets are a crucial part** of simulating a game. Depending on the configuration and implementation of a game,
outcomes like max wins may be extremely rare and possibly don't occur naturally during, for example, 1,000,000 simulations.
With result sets, the program forces such outcomes and retries until the given criteria are met.

  The more unlikely a scenario is to happen, the longer a simulation run may take.

## Defining Result Sets for a Game Mode

The following example shows the definition of 4 common result sets.
This setup ensures that a large portion of all simulations are either zero-win spins or normal base game hits.
A smaller quota is dedicated to generating free spins simulations
and a very small portion ensures enough max win simulations.

```ts lineNumbers
export const gameModes = defineGameModes({
  base: new GameMode({
    name: "base",
    cost: 1,
    rtp: 0.96,
    /* the rest of the configuration */
    resultSets: [
      new ResultSet({
        criteria: "0",
        quota: 0.4,
        multiplier: 0,
        reelWeights: {
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.BASE_GAME]: { base1: 1 },
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.FREE_SPINS]: { bonus1: 1 },
        },
      }),
      new ResultSet({
        criteria: "basegame",
        quota: 0.4,
        reelWeights: {
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.BASE_GAME]: { base1: 1 },
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.FREE_SPINS]: { bonus1: 1 },
        },
      }),
      new ResultSet({
        criteria: "freespins",
        quota: 0.1,
        forceFreespins: true,
        reelWeights: {
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.BASE_GAME]: { base1: 1 },
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.FREE_SPINS]: { bonus1: 3, bonus2: 1 },
        },
      }),
      new ResultSet({
        criteria: "maxwin",
        quota: 0.005,
        forceMaxWin: true,
        forceFreespins: true,
        reelWeights: {
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.BASE_GAME]: { base1: 1 },
          [GameConfig.SPIN_TYPE.FREE_SPINS]: { bonus1: 1, bonus2: 3 },
          evaluate: maxwinReelsEvaluation,
        },
      }),
    ],
  }),
})
```

<Callout title="Small quotas">
  Keep in mind that you'll simulate at least 100.000 spins. If you have a max win quota of
  0.005 and `(quota / totalQuota) * simsAmount` = `(0.005 / 1) * 100.000` = `500`, that's
  perfectly enough variety in max win simulations.

## ResultSet Options

### criteria [!toc]

| Property   | Type     | Required |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| `criteria` | `string` | yes      |

A unique descriptive identifier for the result set.

### quota [!toc]

| Property | Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `quota`  | `number` | yes      |

The quota of simulations that should fall under this result set.

#### Example [!toc]

Let's say you have these 3 result sets:

* "basegame": 90 quota
* "freespins": 9 quota
* "maxwin": 1 quota

The total quota here is 100 (but can be any number, doesn't have to be 100).
This means that, for example, every 100th simulation will result in a max win.

When using [optimization](/docs/core/optimization), the quota **does not define the actual frequency** of specific outcomes when playing.
