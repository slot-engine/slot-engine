## How Slot Engine Works

<Callout title="Built for Stake Engine">
  Slot Engine's Core library is designed specifically for Stake Engine integration,
  following similar principles to Stake's Math SDK.
</Callout>

When the [RGS](#rgs-remote-gaming-server) determines a game round outcome,
it randomly selects an entry from a **weighted list of pre-calculated results**.
All possible game outcomes are **predetermined during the build process**
and stored in JSON and CSV files. Slot Engine generates these files,
allowing you to upload them directly to Stake Engine.

Games are configured using [game modes](#game-mode).
For example, you might configure a "base" game mode (normal bet) and a "bonus" game mode (a.k.a. bonus buy).
A single game flow implementation handles all simulations, regardless of the active game mode.

[Result sets](#result-set) are configured for each game mode to determine
whether a [simulation](#simulation) result is accepted or retried until specific acceptance criteria are met.
Multiple result sets ensure diverse and exceptional outcomes across simulations.

Simulation results may produce a suboptimal [RTP](#rtp). This is acceptable,
as an [optimization](#optimization) process typically follows to adjust the values accordingly.

## Terminology

### RGS (Remote Gaming Server)

A remote gaming server that communicates with the client application, accepting bets and returning results to players.

### Game Mode

A game mode defines a **purchasable** game behavior, similar to "bet modes" in the Stake Math SDK.
Game modes can vary in cost, outcomes, symbols, and mechanics.

Common game mode patterns include:

* **Base game** - The standard gameplay at 1x bet multiplier
* **Bonus game** - e.g. 100x bet for instant free spins
* **Super bonus** - e.g. 500x bet for instant super free spins

Players can bet on the base game or purchase bonus features directly.
A "base" mode can still include free spins triggered naturally, while a dedicated "bonus" mode
allows immediate access for an extra cost.

### Simulation

A simulation executes the game flow implementationâ€”equivalent to **pressing the spin button on a slot**.
Each simulation result is stored temporarily until it's either accepted or rejected.
When accepted, the result is stored permanently, the state resets, and a new simulation begins.
When rejected, the simulation retries until acceptance criteria are met.

### Result Set

Defining result sets (similar to "distributions" in the Math SDK) is crucial for **simulating very rare scenarios**.
Even if you configure a simulation to run 1.000.000 spins of a game mode, a max win could be rare enough that it never occurs naturally.
Result sets allow you to **enforce specific outcome quotas**, ensuring simulations retry until the defined criteria are met.

### Optimization

The process of recalculating weights for all outcomes to achieve a specific target [RTP](#rtp).

[Further reading](/docs/core/optimization)

### RTP

Return to Player (RTP) is a percentage that represents the
theoretical amount of money a player can expect to win back over an extended period of gameplay.
