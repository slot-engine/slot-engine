## Introduction

The context (or simulation context) provides access to the underlying hierarchical class structure,
including the board and state, among other things. The context is typically accessed
via the `ctx` parameter in [hooks](/docs/core/config/hooks).

It provides **useful utility functions** to manage state and streamline game development. For example:

```ts lineNumbers
export function onHandleGameFlow(ctx: HookContext<GameType>) {
  const reels = ctx.getRandomReelset()
  ctx.drawBoardWithRandomStops(reels)
  //                           type safe! â¤µ
  const scatter = ctx.config.symbols.get("S")!
  const [count] = ctx.countSymbolsOnBoard(scatter)
}
```

Below is a comprehensive list of context methods and properties available in your game implementation.
