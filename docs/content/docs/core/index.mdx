## Introduction

Slot Engine is a family of TypeScript libraries for building, simulating and testing slot games.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<CircuitBoard className="text-blue-300" />} title='Slot Engine Core'>
  Library for configuring and simulating slot games. Produces output compatible with Stake Engine / Stake RGS.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Server className="text-blue-300" />} title='Slot Engine LGS'>
  Local gaming server. Test your game locally without uploading to Stake Engine and save time during development.
  </Card>

<Callout title="Work in progress" type="warning">
  Slot Engine libraries are not yet officially labelled as "production ready", because some features may be missing.
  The libraries do their job, but expect bugs or changes to the API between versions.
</Callout>

check out ["What is Slot Engine?"](/docs/core/what-is-slot-engine).

Unsure which is right for you? ["Slot Engine vs Stake Math SDK"](/docs/core/slot-engine-vs-stake-math-sdk)
provides an in-depth comparison to help you decide.

## Installation & Setup

Get started creating your first game using the `@slot-engine/core` library.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install package from npm

    Set up your Node.js project and install `@slot-engine/core`. **Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript is highly recommended.**

    **Slot Engine requires Node >= 23.8.0 or >= 22.15.0** to make use of Zstandard compression.

    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="yarn"
    yarn add @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun install @slot-engine/core
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure your game

    This example provides a quick overview to get you started.
    For detailed configuration options, see the [configuration guide](/docs/core/config).

    ```ts title="index.ts"
    import {
      defineUserState,
      defineSymbols,
      defineGameModes,
      InferGameType,
      createSlotGame,
    } from "@slot-engine/core"

    export const userState = defineUserState({ /* ... */ })
    export type UserStateType = typeof userState

    export const symbols = defineSymbols({ /* ... */ })
    export type SymbolsType = typeof symbols

    export const gameModes = defineGameModes({ /* ... */ })
    export type GameModesType = typeof gameModes

    export type GameType = InferGameType<GameModesType, SymbolsType, UserStateType>

    export const game = createSlotGame<GameType>({
      id: "my-game",
      name: "My Game",
      maxWinX: 5000,
      gameModes,
      symbols,
      userState,
      hooks: {},
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Simulate your game

    ```ts title="index.ts"
    game.configureSimulation({
      simRunsAmount: {
        base: 100000,
        bonus: 100000,
      },
      concurrency: 16,
    })

    game.runTasks({
      doSimulation: true,
    })
    ```

    Upon running your code, this will generate JSONL and CSV files containing
    the results of your simulated spins.

    **Currently, the output format is designed for compatibility with Stake Engine.**
    Future versions may support additional platforms as they emerge.
    Output customization is not available at this time.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Important">
  Before configuring your game, familiarize yourself with the [concepts and ideas](/docs/core/core-concepts) of the Core library
  to understand important terminology and background information. If you've used the Stake Math SDK before, many concepts will be familiar.
