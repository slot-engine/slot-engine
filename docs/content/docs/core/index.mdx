## Introduction

Slot Engine is a family of TypeScript libraries for building, simulating and testing slot games.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<CircuitBoard className="text-blue-300" />} title='Slot Engine Core'>
  Library for configuring and simulating slot games. Produces output compatible with Stake Engine / Stake RGS.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Server className="text-blue-300" />} title='Slot Engine LGS'>
  Local gaming server. Test your game locally without uploading to Stake Engine and save time during development.
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout title="Work in progress / Beta" type="warning">
  Slot Engine libraries are not yet officially labelled as "production ready", because some features may be missing.
  The libraries do their job, but expect bugs or changes to the API between versions.
</Callout>

### Further Reading

To learn more about Slot Engine and it's features, check out ["What is Slot Engine?"](/docs/core/what-is-slot-engine).

Head over to this in-depth comparison.

## Installation & Setup

Get started creating your first game using the `@slot-engine/core` library.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install package from npm

    Set up your Node.js (>= 24) project and install `@slot-engine/core`. **Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript is highly recommended.**

    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="yarn"
    yarn add @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun install @slot-engine/core
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure your game

    Be sure to check out the docs for all individual configuration options,
    since this should only provide you a quick overview of how to get started.

    You can [read more here](/docs/core/config).

    ```ts title="index.ts"
    import {
      defineUserState,
      defineSymbols,
      defineGameModes,
      InferGameType,
      createSlotGame,
    } from "@slot-engine/core"

    export const userState = defineUserState({ /* ... */ })
    export type UserStateType = typeof userState

    export const symbols = defineSymbols([ /* ... */ ])
    export type SymbolsType = typeof symbols

    export const gameModes = defineGameModes({ /* ... */ })
    export type GameModesType = typeof gameModes

    export type GameType = InferGameType<GameModesType, SymbolsType, UserStateType>

    export const game = createSlotGame<GameType>({
      id: "my-game",
      name: "My Game",
      maxWinX: 5000,
      gameModes,
      symbols,
      userState,
      hooks: {},
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Simulate your game

    Configure simulation to see your game's theoretical outcomes, RTP, and other key metrics.

    ```ts title="index.ts"
    game.configureSimulation({
      simRunsAmount: {
        base: 100000,
        bonus: 100000,
      },
      concurrency: 16,
    })

    game.runTasks({
      doSimulation: true,
    })
    ```

    Upon running your code, this will output JSONL and CSV files containing
    the results of your n simulated spins.

    **Right now, the output is formatted to be compatible with Stake Engine.**
    Should other opportunities like Stake Engine arise in the future, Slot Engine might support those too.
    The output is not customizable at this point.

    [Read more](/docs/core/simulation) about game simulations.

</Steps>

<Callout title="Important">
  Before configuring your game, it's worth to get familiar with the [concepts and ideas](/docs/core/core-concepts) of the Core library
  to learn important terminology and background info. If you've used the Stake Math SDK before, many concepts will feel familiar.
