## Introduction

Slot Engine is a family of TypeScript libraries for building, simulating and testing slot games.

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<CircuitBoard className="text-fd-primary" />} title='Slot Engine Core'>
  Library for configuring and simulating slot games. Produces output compatible with Stake Engine / Stake RGS.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<LayoutDashboard className="text-fd-primary" />} title='Slot Engine Panel'>
  Web GUI for interacting with Slot Engine. Run simulations, view statistics, explore game files.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Server className="text-fd-primary" />} title='Slot Engine LGS'>
  Local gaming server. Test your game locally without the need to upload to Stake Engine and save time during development.
  </Card>

## Installation & Setup

Get started creating your first game using the `@slot-engine/core` library.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install package from npm

    Set up your Node.js project and install `@slot-engine/core`. **Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript is highly recommended.**

    **Slot Engine requires Node >= 23.8.0 or >= 22.15.0** to make use of native Zstandard compression features.

    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm i @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="yarn"
    yarn add @slot-engine/core
    ```

    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun install @slot-engine/core
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure your game

    This example provides a quick overview to get you started.
    For detailed configuration options, see the [configuration guide](/docs/core/config).

    ```ts lineNumbers title="index.ts"
    import {
      defineUserState,
      defineSymbols,
      defineGameModes,
      InferGameType,
      createSlotGame,
    } from "@slot-engine/core"

    export const userState = defineUserState({ /* ... */ })
    export type UserStateType = typeof userState

    export const symbols = defineSymbols({ /* ... */ })
    export type SymbolsType = typeof symbols

    export const gameModes = defineGameModes({ /* ... */ })
    export type GameModesType = typeof gameModes

    export type GameType = InferGameType<GameModesType, SymbolsType, UserStateType>

    export const game = createSlotGame<GameType>({
      id: "my-game",
      name: "My Game",
      maxWinX: 5000,
      scatterToFreespins: {},
      gameModes,
      symbols,
      userState,
      hooks: {},
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure simulation

    ```ts lineNumbers=30 title="index.ts"
    game.configureSimulation({
      simRunsAmount: {
        base: 100000,
        bonus: 100000,
      },
      concurrency: 16,
    })

    game.runTasks({
      doSimulation: true,
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run simulations

    Running simulations will generate JSONL and CSV files containing the results of your simulated spins.
    The easiest way to do this is by using the [`tsx` library](https://tsx.is/).

    ```sh
    cd ./path-to/your-game
    pnpm tsx ./index.ts --slot-engine-run
    ```

    <Callout title="Important">
      For technical reasons, the flag `--slot-engine-run` is required when running your game
    </Callout>

    **Currently, the output format is designed for compatibility with Stake Engine.**
    Future versions may support additional platforms as they emerge.
    Output customization is not available at this time.

    [Learn more](/docs/core/game-tasks/simulation) about game simulations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Important">
  Before configuring your game, familiarize yourself with the [concepts and ideas](/docs/core/core-concepts) of the Core library
  to understand important terminology and background information. If you've used the Stake Math SDK before, many concepts will be familiar.

## FAQ / Common Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting 'Module not found' errors when running the game">
    Ensure you `cd`'ed into the game directory where your game file is.

    If you're running the game from a different directory, add `rootDir: __dirname` to your game configuration.
