## Upgrade from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

### Adjust npm scripts or commands [!toc]

Due to technical changes and Panel compatibility, tasks (simulation, optimization, analysis) are only run
when explicitly passing a command line argument. The required argument is `--slot-engine-run`.

For example, when you're using `tsx` to run your games, this is how you must adjust your command:

```bash tab="Before"
  pnpm tsx ./index.ts
```

```bash tab="After"
  pnpm tsx ./index.ts --slot-engine-run
```

### Note introduction of new generated files [!toc]

The Core library now produces additional files which contain metadata or other information.
When you're using the new Panel package these files are mandatory for flawless Panel functionality.
Re-run simulations to generate those files.

- `books_chunks/*` (new)
- `books_<name>.index.meta.json` (new)
- `force_keys_<mode>.json` (new)
- `lookUpTable_<mode>.index` (new)
- `lookUpTableSegmented_<mode>.index` (new)
- `simulation_summary.json` (new)
- `stats_payouts.json` (modified structure)

### Note new book files generation [!toc]

Uncompressed book files are no longer generated. This saves a lot of hard drive space.
If you need to inspect your book files, you can use the new Panel package.

### Recommendations [!toc]

#### Replace your `console.log()` calls [!toc]

Logging to the console from worker threads is not reliable. A more robust approach to logging
during simulations was added. Access the `log()` method from the data service in your game implementation:
`ctx.services.data.log()`

#### Prefix static reels files with `reels_` [!toc]

If you want to use the reel set editor included in Panel, you must rename your
reels CSV files to something like `reels_your-reelset-name.csv`.
Panel scans your game directory for CSV files starting with `reels_` - only those are editable in the reel set editor.
