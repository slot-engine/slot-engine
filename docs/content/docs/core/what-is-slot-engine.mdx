## Introduction

Slot Engine is a comprehensive TypeScript library ecosystem for building slot games.
It provides robust mathematical and game logic foundations, with client visualization capabilities planned for future releases.

The term "Slot Engine" refers to both the complete ecosystem and the core library specifically.

## Why Slot Engine

The launch of Stake Engine in 2025 introduced a platform where developers can publish games to the world's largest casino,
bringing a new wave of developers and studios into the space.

While Stake provides a purpose-built SDK, it has limitations discussed [on this page](/docs/core/slot-engine-vs-stake-math-sdk).

Since Stake's math SDK is written in Python, many developers—particularly those with web development backgrounds in TypeScript or JavaScript—
face barriers to entry when creating games.
**Slot Engine provides TypeScript and JavaScript developers with an alternative for creating slot games.**
