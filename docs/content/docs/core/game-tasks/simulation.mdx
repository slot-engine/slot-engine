## Introduction

Configuring a game alone isn't enough - it also has to be simulated to ensure correct functionality.

Simulating your game is quite simple:

<Steps>
<Step>
Call `configureSimulation()` on your game

```ts lineNumbers
const game = createSlotGame({ /* ... */ })

game.configureSimulation({
  simRunsAmount: {
    base: 100_000,
    bonus: 100_000,
  },
  concurrency: 16,
})
```

- `simRunsAmount` defines the amount of simulations for each game mode. For quick and dirty testing
you can do 10_000 simulations, but for production a minimum of 500_000 is recommended. If you do not wish
to simulate certain game modes, just exclude them from `simRunsAmount`.
- `concurrency` controls the amount of threads (Node workers) used for simulation.
</Step>

<Step>
Finally call `runTasks()` on your game

```ts lineNumbers=11
game.runTasks({
  doSimulation: true,
})
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Simulation time can range from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on game modes,
simulation count, thread concurrency, and your hardware.

## Output Files / Publish Files

The output will be written to the `__build__/publish_files` directory. Those are the **final files**
that can be uploaded to Stake Engine as the "math" part.

### books_\<gameMode>.jsonl.zst [!toc]

For each game mode a books file is generated which contains a list of all books (simulations).
That file is compressed using Zstandard compression, because book files tend to get quite large the more events you have.

```jsonl
{"id":1,"payoutMultiplier":780,"events":[{"index":1,"type":"test","data":{"test":123}}]}
{"id":2,"payoutMultiplier":1000,"events":[{"index":1,"type":"test","data":{"test":123}}]}
{"id":3,"payoutMultiplier":0,"events":[{"index":1,"type":"test","data":{"test":123}}]}
...
```

### index.json [!toc]

An overview of all simulated game modes and their corresponding file names.

### lookUpTable_\<gameMode>_0.csv [!toc]

The lookup table contains a list of all book IDs, a weight, and the payout multiplier (scaled by 100).

A book's weight determines the probability of that outcome being selected by the Stake RGS when resolving a bet.

**By default**, all results have an **equal probability** of being selected.

```csv
ID, weight, payout
1,1,780
2,1,1000
3,1,0
...
```

Since every outcome has the same weight, initial game RTP will likely be too high or too low - this is completely normal.
You will use [optimization](/docs/core/game-tasks/optimization) to automatically redistribute weights
to achieve a specific target RTP with high precision.

## FAQ / Common Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My simulation is very slow or stuck">
    The most common reason for why your simulation might be stuck or progress very slowly is that
    certain **outcomes are very rare** or might **never occurr** naturally, for example max wins.

    If you're noticing that simulating max wins or other rare criteria slows down your simulation,
    there's a few things you can do:

    - Make it easier for the program to simulate rare outcomes, for example by using a dedicated
    reel set with more wilds and generally higher symbols.
