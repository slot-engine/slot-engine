## Introduction

Configure analysis to get useful statistics about your game.

Analyzing your game is quite simple:

<Steps>
<Step>
Simply adjust your `runTasks()` configuration to include analysis:

```ts lineNumbers=11
game.runTasks({
  // ...
  doAnalysis: true,
  analysisOpts: {
    gameModes: ["base"],
    // Optionally analyze hit rates of tagged simulations
    recordStats: [
      { groupBy: ["symbolId", "kind", "spinType"] }, // Hit rates of win combinations
      { groupBy: ["criteria"] }, // Hit rates of criteria
    ],
  },
})
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Analyze Hit Rates

Using the option `recordStats`, you can generate the `stats_records.json` file to get
a breakdown of hit rates for simulations with arbitrary tags.
Hit rates are calculated considering the weights in the lookup table.

`recordStats` is an array of configurations, where a config item is built like this:

```ts
interface RecordStatsConfig {
  /**
   * Properties to group by from the recorded search entries.
   * E.g. `["symbolId", "kind", "spinType"]` for symbol hit rates.
   */
  groupBy: string[]
  /**
   * Optional filter to only include records matching these values.
   */
  filter?: Record<string, string>
  /**
   * Optional custom name for this stats group in the output.
   */
  name?: string
}
```

The resulting file will look like this:

```json title="stats_records.json"
[
  {
    "gameMode": "base",
    "groups": [
      {
        "name": "symbolId_kind_spinType",
        "groupBy": ["symbolId", "kind", "spinType"],
        "items": [
          {
            "key": "L3|5|basegame",
            "properties": {
              "symbolId": "L3",
              "kind": "5",
              "spinType": "basegame"
            },
            "count": 39979,
            "hitRateString": "1 in 12",
            "hitRate": 11.739591272077966
          }
          // ...
        ]
      }
      // ...
    ]
  }
]
```

## Output Files / Publish Files

The output will be written to the `__build__` directory.

### stats_payouts.json [!toc]

Contains a list of win ranges and how many simulations (from the final lookup table) fall into those ranges.

### stats_summary.json [!toc]

Contains various statistics about volatility, hit rates, etc.

### stats_records.json [!toc]

Arbitrary hit rate analysis.
