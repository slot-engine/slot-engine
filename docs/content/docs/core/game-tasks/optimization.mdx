## Introduction

After simulating and analyzing the outcomes of your game, you may notice that
your RTP may be too high or too low and that the game may generally be unbalanced.
To achieve a desired target RTP between 90% and 99%, the optimization program can be used.

**A big thanks to Stake** for providing the entire game optimizer code.
[(Original source code)](https://github.com/StakeEngine/math-sdk/tree/main/optimization_program)

The optimization program (from 13.08.25) has been integrated into Slot Engine,
enabling you to precisely adjust your games to achieve the desired RTP.
Additionally, you can further tweak the weights of certain payout groups using custom configs.

After optimization is done, you can observe that the weights in your lookup tables have been redistributed.

Before:

```csv
1,1,780
2,1,1000
3,1,0
...
```

After:

```csv
1,1816455674,780
2,58062661,1000
3,19165815565,0
...
```

<Callout title="To other developers:">
The optimizer works, but **it would be nice to not depend on Stake** updating their original optimizer code.
Since their optimizer is designed to work with their math SDK, integrating new optimizer changes into
Slot Engine might not always work.

I don't know Rust and have no mathematical background, and the optimization algorithm seems complex.
If anyone would like to try to **implement such an algorithm in TypeScript**, feel free to open an issue and let's talk about it.

Having a **first-party** optimization algorithm would be **good in the long run**.
