## Introduction

Slot Engine Panel is part of Slot Engine, a family of TypeScript libraries for building, simulating and testing slot games.

Panel is a web GUI for interacting with, and inspecting Slot Engine games.
It features various useful tools for Slot Engine game developers:

- Game statistics overview
- Payout statistics (payout occurrences, unique payout counts)
- Game simulation (configuration, start, stop)
- Simulation insights
- Bet (crowd) simulation
- Reel set designer
- Books & events explorer

## Installation & Setup

Set up Panel using the `@slot-engine/panel` library.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install package from npm

    Set up your Node.js project and install `@slot-engine/panel`.<br/>
    It's recommended to set up Panel in the same repository as your game(s), but that's not a requirement.

    <Callout>
    Slot Engine Panel requires your games to use `@slot-engine/core` >= 0.2.0.
    </Callout>

    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm i @slot-engine/panel
    ```

    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm i @slot-engine/panel
    ```

    ```bash tab="yarn"
    yarn add @slot-engine/panel
    ```

    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun install @slot-engine/panel
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure Panel

    Set up Panel in a separate file.
    For detailed configuration options, see the [configuration guide](/docs/panel/config).

    ```ts lineNumbers title="index.ts"
    import { createPanel } from "@slot-engine/panel"
    import { game as MyGame } from "../../path-to/my-game"

    const panel = createPanel({
      games: [MyGame],
    })

    panel.start()
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Ensure Game Compatibility

    For Panel to be able to resolve file paths correctly, your game needs to specify the configuration option `rootDir: __dirname`.
    Also, your game must use `@slot-engine/core` >= 0.2.0.

    ```ts lineNumbers title="game/index.ts"
    export const game = createSlotGame<GameType>({
      rootDir: __dirname, // required if connecting this game to @slot-engine/panel
      // ...
    })
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run Panel

    You can run the file however you like. The easiest way to do this is by using the [`tsx` library](https://tsx.is/).

    ```sh
    cd ./path-to/your-panel
    pnpm tsx watch ./index.ts
    ```

    Running Panel in watch mode is not required, but recommended.
    This way Panel will recognize changes to your game and you don't need to restart Panel after every change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

When you're coming from `@slot-engine/core` 0.1.x, some features of Panel may not work correctly the first time you launch it.
Slot Engine Panel needs some files which are only generated during a simulation run.
If you notice obvious 404 or 500 errors when using Panel for the first time,
ensure your game is on a compatible Core version and re-run simulations.
This should generate the necessary files Panel needs.
