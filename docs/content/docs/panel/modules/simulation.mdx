## Overview

The simulation module mirrors the behavior of the `game.configureSimulation()` method.

Simulations can be configured, started and stopped from here. You will get visual feedback on
the simulation progress. The terminal UI will still function normally and may contain further logs
which are not viewable in Panel (yet).

### Simulation Summary

After simulation, a detailed breakdown of the simulation is displayed.
This information is also logged to the console.
