## Overview

The reel set designer module allows editing reel set CSV files via a drag and drop editor.


## Usage

### Make Reel Set editable in editor

Panel scans your game directory for any CSV files with the naming schema `reels_*.csv`.
Those files will be available for editing in the UI.

### Add new Reel Sets

Currently you can not create new CSV files via the UI. This feature will be added in a future update.

For now, create a new CSV file named `reels_<some-name>.csv` somewhere in your game directory.
