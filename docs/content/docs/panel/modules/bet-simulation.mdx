## Overview

The bet simulation (or crowd simulation) module simulates game behavior with multiple players betting on the game under equal circumstances.
For each "spin" a virtual player does, a random weighted result from the lookup table is chosen, similar to real Stake RGS functionality.

There can be multiple simulation configurations and each can be run independently and simultaneously.

## Configuration

### Virtual Players

| Name             | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Player Count     | How many players are betting on the game.        |
| Starting Balance | Number of balance units each player starts with. |

### Bet Groups

Bet groups allow simulating complex betting sessions. Bet groups are played sequentially.

| Name           | Description                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mode           | Which mode to bet on.            |
| Number of Bets | How many bets to place.          |
| Bet            | Number of balance units per bet. |
